//Implement the probabilistic Treap data structure. It is important that you implement the insertion and deletion operations as described in class. (In particular, be sure to read my note in Webcourses on how deletion is handled, which includes a discussion of how this differs from our traditional approach to BST deletion.) Your Treap class must be generic. Since there is an ordering property in treaps, you must also restrict the type parameter (e.g., AnyType) to classes that implement Comparable.

public class Treap{
